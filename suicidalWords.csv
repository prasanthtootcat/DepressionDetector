die
i wanna end my life
end my life
end life
end my life
wanna die
wanna leave this world
sick of living
I should just kill myself
What will heaven be like
I canâ€™t imagine living the rest of my life like this
I want to disappear
If anything happens to me, promise to take care of
I just want to be done
kill
suicide
sleep permanently
want to die
want to take away my life
wanna take away my life
